# Revised ES sensitivity model based on [Kroiss et al](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208336#sec027)



# Latent disease prevalence
Note, I think we could just as easily make this a model of incidence, and then add delay distributions on case detections vs ES detections. 

Model assumes that underlying prevalence of enterovirus is highly cyclical by month. 
It also assumes that the pattern in cyclic behavior will vary by location (province and district-levels). 

We can write a model for virus prevalence over time in each province $i$ and district $j$, $p_{ij}(t)$ as:

$$
p_{i,j}(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_i + c_{i,j} + f_{global,t}(monthofyear) + f_{i,j,t}(monthofyear) + \alpha p_{i,j}(t-1) 
$$

Where $\beta_0$ is a global intercept (baseline prevalence of virus in the country),
$\beta_i$ is a district-level random intercept,
$c_{i,j}$ is a province-level random intercept,
$f_{global,t}(monthofyear)$ is the global effect of month of the year
$f_{i,j, t}(monthofyear)$ is the province level effect of month of year
and $\alpha p_{i,j}(t-1)$ is an autoregressive term describing the dependence on the estimate at the previous time point

Note we can modify this however we want, the point will just be we want something that can vary, across month of year, across years, and across provinces. 

Then we have our two types of observations, both of which are functions of the prevalence in each province at each time point. 

First, for the clinical cases, we will assume that the number of cases detected in each province and district at time $t$,  $y_{i,j,t}$ among those tested (NP-AFP individuals), $n_{i,j,t}$ follows a binomial obervation model:

$$ 
y_{i,j,t} \sim Bin(n_{i,j,t}, p_{i,j}(t))
$$

This assumes that the prevalence of virus among NP-AFP cases is representative of virus prevalence in the population at large, and there aren't systematic biases in the individuals presenting with NP-AFP cases. 
This differs from if we had clinical cases presenting with symptoms, in which case, we would want to model from incidence --> healthcare seeking behavior. 

For ES detections, we can write a model that describes the latent probability of detection in each site $k$ in district $i$ and province $j$ over time, $q_{i,j,k}(t)$. 
This will be a function of the latent prevalence $p_{i,j}(t)$. 

Following what they have written (but I do not understand so we should revisit this)

$$
log(-log(1-q_{i,j,k}(t))) = \kappa_{0} + \kappa_{k} + f_{k,t}(monthofyear) + \epsilon_{k}log(p_{i,j}(t)) 
$$


Where $\kappa_{0}$ is some transformed baseline probability of detecting a positive (e.g. false positive rate)
$\kappa_{k}$ is some transformed site specific intercept
$f_{k,t}(monthofyear)$ is the site-specific effect of the month of the year (this would acount for temperature, rainfall, etc and its impact on the site's sensitivity)
and $ \epsilon_{k}log(p_{i,j}(t))$ is the impact of prevelance on detection probability 

Lastly, the observation model for ES detections, $D_{k,t}$, which will be in the form of either presence or absence in a particular site $k$ as: 

$$
D_{k,t} \sim Bernoulli(q_{i,j,k}(t))
$$
